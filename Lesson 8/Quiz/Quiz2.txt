Question 1:
Inner variable is declared inside the while loop so that, it can be recreated and reinitialized to 1 each time the outer loop
executes. If the variable were to be declared before the outer loop, it will never reset to 1 or we'd have to do it with an 
assignment variable. In the smallest possible scope, it makes more sense to declare the inner variable inside the outer variabble
while loop
